# CodeCurrent
## What we do?

* Codecurrent is aiming to turn into a CP buddy for you, in today's time, we see several coding platforms: Leetcode, CodeChef, Codeforces, Spoj, HackerRank, HackerEarth, etc. Each one of us is confused about which platform to follow.
* We all feel that somehow some questions in each platform are sharing the same coding paradigm. 
* People keep on bouncing among platforms in search of the right questions and a proper problem set to make their logic strong and eventually waste a lot of time and energy. Here we come to your aid to do what is needed to keep you focussed on enhancing your DSA skills.

## How and Why we do?
* We try to build a problem ladder for you from all these leading coding platforms and many other sources where you can find the most optimized question pool based on their difficulty, applied concepts, and topics.
* We carefully curate the questions, which will enhance your understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms logic and concepts. 
* Prepare the most "HOT" sequence of questions which are trending on different platforms. 
* To crack the product-based interviews, we built a ladder covering concepts of programming rounds.

## Getting Started with Platform
* Various solutions will be available to you starting from the very naive to most optimized approach so that whenever you need help, these will be available.
* In this way, you can grab the concepts quickly and prepare for the interviews simultaneously by only focusing on the specific set of problems that will help you to grow exponentially. 
* *Time is precious, invest it carefully!!!*
