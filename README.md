# CodeCurrent
## What we do?
Codecurrent is aiming to turn into a CP buddy for you, in today's time we see several coding platforms, let it be Leetcode, CodeChef, Codeforces, Spoj, HackerRank, HackerEarth etc. Each one of us is confused which platform to follow, because we all feel that somehow some questions in each platform are sharing the same coding paradigm. People keep on bouncing among platforms in search of good questions and a proper problem set to make their logics strong and eventually end up wasting a lot of time and energy. Here we come to your aid, we do all that is needed to keep you focussed in enhancing your DSA skills.

- We try to build a probelm ladder for you from all these platforms together where you can find most optimized question sets based on their difficulty, applied concepts and topics.
- The ladder will comprise question pools from all the famous coding platforms and many other sources.
- We carefully curate the questions which will enhance your understanding of DS conecpts and logics. 
- Prepare the most "HOT" sequence of questions which are trending on different platforms. 
- To crack the product-based interviews, we built a ladder which covers most of the concepts which are asked in programming rounds.

<strong> NOW WHAT !!! I KNOW THE QUESTIONS BUT HOW TO SOLVE THEM ? </strong>
- A range of multiple solutions will be available to you starting from the very naive to most optimized approach, so that whenever you need help, these will be available.

<p> In this way you can grab the concepts very fast and prepare for the interviews at the same time by only focusing on the specific set of problems which will help you to grow exponentially. </p>
#### Time is precious, invest it carefully!!!
