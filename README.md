# CodeCurrent
## What we do?
Codecurrent is aiming to turn into a CP buddy for you, in today's time we see several coding platforms let it be Leetcode, CodeChef, Codeforces, Spoj, HackerRank, HackerEarth etc. Each one of us is confused which platform to follow, because we all feel that somehow some questions in each platform are sharing the same coding paradigm and concepts, we try to build a ladder for you from different platforms together where you can find most optimised question sets from all of these platforms, the ladder will comprise questions pool out of all those platforms.
